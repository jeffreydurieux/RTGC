Regularization Towards Group Components (RGTC) information document.
This produrce uses threeway data as input. A component analysis is performed on each individual matrix and a ridge like penalty is used on the difference between the individual component scores and a pre-specified (group) component score matrix. The stronger the penalty, the more alike the individual component scores are to the group components.
