# Regularization Towards Group Components (RGTC).

This repository contains code for RGTC.

## Functions

- RTGC: the main function of this project. Performs multisubject component 
analysis with a regularization towards pre-specified group components.

- RTGC_single: helper function that performs single subject component analysis
with a regularization towards pre-specified group components.


## TODO

Incorporate SCA when no pre-specified group components are given.

Investigate leave one out group component structure.

add Procrustes rotation to align individual components to group components.
